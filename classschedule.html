                            <p class="bigdesc">This course examines fundamental aspects of life at the level of cells and molecules. Major themes addressed in the course include the nature of biologically important molecules and how that relates to the structural organization of cells, the cellular mechanisms of heredity and reproduction; 3) mechanisms by which cell functions are regulated, and the central pathways of metabolic energy conversions. Throughout the course, strong emphasis will be placed upon the relationship between complexity of function and complexity of structure, as well as upon the importance of energy in any process having complex outcomes.</p>
